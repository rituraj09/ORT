                                    Tough traveler? Doesn’t ring a bell. Well, onerooftravel.com is talking about the travelers who are looking for extreme travel adventures spread all over the world. This is not for the faint hearted but brave hearted who want to break free of the norms of traveling. The coldest, hottest, driest and wettest inhabited places could be a nightmare for an average traveler. However, if this is something that excites you and gives you goose bumps, then come and take a virtual tour with us:
                                    <br/><strong>Coldest Place:</strong> It has to be in Russia due to its proximity to the North Pole. Oymyakon, a remote village in Russia, is considered the coldest inhabited place with average temperature hovering around -58 F. It’s a two-day drive from the regional capital, Yakutsk and was once used as a place for political exiles. Though Oymyakon means unfrozen water, the ground remains frozen all year round. With only one hotel, your hotel-booking plan could hit a snag. Nevertheless, ice sports like skiing, ice fishing and hockey are popular with tourists here. Get ready for frigid temperatures and unforgiving weather.
                                    <br/><strong>Hottest Place:</strong> It’s Dasht-e Loot, which means toasted wheat, in Iran. The temperatures hit as high as 158 F and it opened a year ago for tourists after being off-limits for long. It is known for unique landscapes, arid desert and sweltering heat. Dehydration is a common problem and you may not find the luxury of a hotel here. If you can handle the heat, go hit the dry desert on camel back.

                                    <img src="images/driest_place.jpg" />
                                    <br/><strong>Driest Place:</strong> Atacama Desert in Chile is the driest place and attracts a good number of tourists all year round. For 15 long years, from 1903 to 1918, it was deprived of a single drop of rain. It is ideal for landscape photographers to take pictures of salt lakes and wind-sculpted canyons. It has virtually no greenery and NASA, which also conducted a test for Mars rovers, compares the soil to Mars.
                                    <br/><strong>Wettest Place:</strong> From no rainfall to the place where it does not rain, it pours. Situated in the northeast of India, Mawsynram is the wettest place with an average annual rainfall of 467 inches. Interestingly, the second wettest place also happens to be in the same state and apparently, both are in the race for being the top contender. One can visit Mawsmai falls, Mawsmai Caves and Cherapunjee too. You will witness huge stalagmite, lush green vegetation and of course, heavy rainfall.
