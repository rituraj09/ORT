                                    <br/><span id="veniceSpan"></span>
                                    <strong style="color: #00A8FF;">Venice</strong><br/>
                                    The name of the city alone speaks for itself. The moment you read it, all you can picture is colorful buildings and canals, with beautifully crafted bridges and massive ‘gondolas’ moving lazily beneath them. Venice, for sure, is a honeymooner’s dream. Hollywood movies alone have made it a go-to place for everyone looking to celebrate love. Venice has been tagged as the ‘Most Romantic Location’ on countless occasions by various global travelling magazines, and it surely does justice to this title.
                                    This city has its own historical charm and modern persona, which blend together perfectly to create a truly enthralling experience for anyone who is fortunate enough to be there. You will find really great historical heritage hotels existing in peaceful harmony with motels here. Hotel booking won’t be a problem, considering the fact that all these places have digitized their booking procedures now.
                                    Row down the Grand Canal in the historic gondolas while you are there, and don't forget to take a trip down to St. Mark's Basilica. A calm evening walk at the Bridge of Sighs is a must for all the newlyweds out there.

                                    <strong style="color: #00A8FF;">Ibiza</strong><br/>
                                    If Venice is the romantic capital; Ibiza has to be the nightlife capital of the world. A small secluded island in the Mediterranean Sea south of Spain, Ibiza is a place that has long been overlooked by most; thus helping to maintain its sanctity and beauty. If your spouse is a music lover, taking them here on a honeymoon could be the best gift that you could ever present them with. Ibiza is now known worldwide to house the best music cafes, lounges and discos, that come to life at night, and turn this tiny island into a strictly party zone.
                                    This place also houses some really magnificent beaches and outdoor locations. See them to believe them! If you are an adventure sports lover, make sure you see the Calade Sant Vicent, and indulge in group activities like hilling, beach volleyball, pool polo. Also make a visit to one of the numerous light houses that dot the beaches here. Sant Joan de Labridja is an important tourist attraction in Ibiza, famous for its churches, and for several beaches that are famous for group yoga in the morning.
                                    If you are an international traveler, it will be wise to get your travel insured, so lookout for the best travel agency out there. For onerooftravels, customer satisfaction has always been and will always be of paramount importance.

                                    <strong style="color: #00A8FF;">Santorini</strong><br/>
                                    Santorini is a tiny island in Greece, which we are sure not many have heard of. Santorini is a hidden gem for all the romantics out there! It has been in existence since the time period of the ancient Greek civilization and holds great historic significance. The clear deep blue water all around and pristine pearl white settlements throughout the island make it a treat for the sight. You will find some really good hotels to spend time here. The best part is, most of them will turn out to be pocket friendly for you! Always check out our best discounted hotel deals before making a booking; who knows what’s waiting for you!

                                    <strong style="color: #00A8FF;">Greece</strong><br/>
                                    Probably one of the few countries in the world that boast of both, a rich cultural heritage and history, as well as picturesque landscapes, it will be unfair if Greece doesn’t feature on this list.
                                    Greece is a country well renowned for its ancient architecture and cities that date back to the ancient Greek civilization. Greece has been home to some of the most beautiful cities and towns that mankind has ever thrived in, and a visit to these places is mandatory, if you and your spouse are both true explorers. History buffs will love every nook and cranny of this country.
                                    While you are there, make sure you visit the ancient city of Athens, which has hints of history as well as a dash of modernization. Also visit Thessaloniki for its ancient Roman ruins, churches and the famous ‘white tower’. A trip down to Greece would be incomplete without visiting Samos, the little island which is a home to several ancient ruins – some of which are pre-historic and really awe inspiring, including various beautiful beaches. Mykonos too is an important town famous for its lively and vibrant nightlife, as well as serene beaches.
