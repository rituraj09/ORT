                            If you are a food lover, chances are pretty high that food forms an important part of your daily routine. No, it’s not just eating for survival; or for the sake of passing time around when you are bored, or to comply with your daily calorie intake (although gym freaks might disagree). When you are a foodie, it’s just an innate quality in you to look out for and appreciate good food.
                            And India is one of those few countries, where the cuisine and food palate changes with every few miles that you traverse through the length and breadth of the country. What makes Indian cuisine so special, is the presence and influence of diverse cultures since time immemorial, which blend together profusely to create such palpable and rich edible goodness, that it’s hard to not get impressed with the food that is served here, once you have had it.

                            <br/>Being one of the largest countries in the world, the culinary experience that one gains in India is diverse and huge. Every corner of the country is famous for its own style of preparation and cuisine, thus it becomes essential for everyone visiting the country, to embark on this voyage of great culinary experience and delight.  Let’s take a look at few of the most famous cuisines of India; which are separated by miles and miles of distance, but united by only one motto: Taste that redefines the definition of ‘heaven on palate’ for you.

                            <br/>Going down south, it’ll be unfair to not mention the Keralite cuisine down south. This coastal state is one of the southernmost states of the country, and has long been known as the spice capital of the country. In fact, Vasco da Gama discovered India while voyaging on the spice route to this very place! So you know the importance of food in the lives of the people residing here.
                            Apart from its golden crispy ‘dosas’ and soft ‘appams’, Kerala is famous for its sea food, particularly the ‘Kerala Fish Fry’ – this deep fried goodness is sure to tantalize your taste buds and leave them dancing for a while! Enjoy delicious sea food in the lap of mother nature, gazing at the sunset from the backwaters; life couldn’t get any better!

                            <br/>Coming to the northern half of the country, Punjab-the land of five rivers, is famous for its rendition of food throughout the world today. Almost every major city in any major country of the world houses at least one authentic Punjabi restaurant! And it is for a reason.
                            Punjab, apart from being the most prosperous state of the country, is also the taste capital of northern India. Almost all major dishes that are famous in north India, have their origins based somewhere in Punjab.
                            Be it the Dal Makhni or Shahi Paneer or Rajma, Tandoori Roti or Makke di Roti, name it and Punjab has it. Coming to the meaty delights for the non vegetarians out there, there has been no love lost for the Butter Chicken in any corner of the world, and the Tandoori Chicken has already spread its magic in the country and spread like wildfire. Mind you, these originated in Punjab and are here to stay forever!
                            The North Eastern part of the country is a mysteriously magical place. No, we are not just talking about the scenic beauty here. This region owes some of its magic to its out of the worldly culinary delights too.
                            Momos, the humble steamed doughs of goodness, have spread and conquered almost the entire country, and made everyone their fans. Filled in with fresh cut vegetables and/or minced meat, this dish is as simple as food can get. The North Eastern states also offer some amazing varieties of dimsums and authentic noodles. Eat them to believe them!
